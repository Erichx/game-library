<p align="center">A simple game library, created in react with pure CSS.</p>

# requirements

[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Also it's nice to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# install

Once you have the pre-requirements installed, you can open your bash and following the commands:

$ git clone <https://github.com/Erichx/game-library>

# installing the back-end dependencies

$ cd server
$ npm install

# running the back-end

$npm start

# to access back-end

http://localhost:3001/

# installing the front-end dependencies

$ cd client
$ npm install

# running the front-end

$npm start

# to access front-end

http://localhost:3001/
